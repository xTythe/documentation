# The Tythe Protocol

Tythe is a decentralized orchestration layer designed to establish the first global standard for assetized credibility. It serves as the foundational infrastructure for a risk-intelligent, borderless economy, enabling humans and AI agents to prove their reliability without compromising their privacy or relying on centralized intermediaries. For digital institutions, DeFi protocols, DAOs, and cross-sector applications, Tythe provides the critical rails to scale operations by offloading data liability, automating risk enforcement, and mitigating wallet disposability risks with verifiable, real-time intelligence.

<summary><strong>What is Credibility?</strong></summary>

Inside the Tythe ecosystem, credibility is treated as a multi-dimensional asset. While traditional systems focus narrowly on debt history, Tythe recognizes that the complete picture of any actor's reliability is composed of diverse, verifiable signals across digital and physical landscapes.

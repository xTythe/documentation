# The Tythe Protocol

Tythe is a decentralized orchestration layer designed to establish the first global standard for assetized credibility. For decades, the global economy has relied on traditional off-chain models like FICO that utilize black-box algorithms and centralized bureaus for sensitive PII storage. These systems create single points of failure and compromised user sovereignty, relying on lagging reports and biological identifiers that impose an "AI ceiling"—effectively excluding millions of solvent actors and synthetic entities from the economy. While current on-chain models like Cred improve accessibility, they remain limited to querying histories of disposable wallet-addresses, leaving protocols vulnerable to Sybil manipulation and identity recycling without a framework for real-world enforcement.

Tythe delivers the orchestrated credibility model, a zk-private infrastructure that bridges these systemic gaps. By unifying self-sovereign DIDs (via TRIS) with credibility data (DISC), Tythe transforms multi-dimensional behavior—across Compliance, Finance, Governance, Security, and Sustainability—into standardized, policy-enforceable credibility data. This allows humans and AI agents to anchor, own, and monetize their reliability profiles with zero PII exposure and proof latency in a matter of seconds, not weeks. By moving beyond the narrow lens of debt-based creditworthiness, Tythe provides the critical infrastructure required for digital institutions, DeFi protocols, DAOs, climate and sustainability initiatives, and financial applications to offload data liability, automate risk enforcement, and scale operations with verifiable, real-time intelligence.
